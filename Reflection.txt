<p>I learned many new lessons during the 1st Quarter in ICT. I learned how to code lists, tables, links, and forms. I also learned the strict rules on how to properly code an HTML file to create a properly displayed webpage. I learned the importance of these coding lessons in real life. These lessons are the foundation for a sustainable and successful website.</p><br/><br/>

<p>These lessons have multiple <b>practical application</b>. They can be used to build basic websites and create a strong basis for advanced website designs. XHTML has strict rules, reminding every coder to build websites with accuracy and precision. It reminds coders to recheck their code before publishing their website. Lists organize terms and points that we write in our website. It makes it easier for viewers to understand your main points or helps them find information much faster. Tables are effective organizers in websites. They divide the website into numerous sections, helping coders classify their information correctly and helping viewers find the information they need. Forms are very important for getting the viewers' feedback. Their responses can help coders improve their websites and reduce bugs.</p><br/><br/>

<p>I learned how to implement CSS during the 2nd quarter in ICT. I learned how CSS can be used to <b>improve the layout and design of websites, and how it saves time for programmers</b>. CSS offers a wide variety of options for modifying and creatively structuring websites. CSS has made websites visually appealing and easier to navigate for viewers, making it user-friendly.</p><br><br>

<p>I learned about the three types of CSS: Inline, Internal, and External. I learned about the syntax and declarations of CSS. I learned how to become creative and combine HTML and CSS to make numerous beautiful web pages. I learned about the different properties and values in CSS.</p><br><br>

<p>Overall, I believe that I can use CSS to create user-friendly and visually appealing websites for viewers to easily navigate and view my content in a structured, well-designed manner.</p><br><br><br><br>

<h1>Quarter 4 Reflection</h1>

<p>Though the 4th Quarter had fewer lessons unlike the previous quarters, I continue to learn. I learned about the popup boxes, conditional statements, and loops in Javascript. These lessons can help me continue to improve my website-building skills using Javascript. They provide more options for coders to diversify and enhance their websites.<br><br>

For me, life is like ICT. Without properly structuring our daily lives, we could fail to meet our expected outcomes. It also reminds us to properly recheck the things that we do to avoid any unnecessary errors. ICT taught me that consistent practice helps hone our skills (whether it's coding or any other life skill).</p><br><br><br>
